# Customer Segmentation using SQL
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze customer data and segment them based on their spending behavior using basic SQL concepts.

# We use simple SQL clauses like:
SELECT
WHERE
GROUP BY
ORDER BY
CASE
HAVING
Dataset Details

# Table: customers
Column Name	Data Type	Description
customer_id	INT	Unique customer ID
customer_name	VARCHAR(50)	Customer name
city	VARCHAR(50)	Customer city
age	INT	Customer age
total_spent	DECIMAL(10,2)	Total money spent
number_of_orders	INT	Total orders placed
Table Creation
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    total_spent DECIMAL(10,2),
    number_of_orders INT
);

# Sample Data
INSERT INTO customers VALUES
(1, 'Amit', 'Bangalore', 25, 12000, 5),
(2, 'Neha', 'Mumbai', 30, 45000, 12),
(3, 'Raj', 'Delhi', 22, 8000, 3),
(4, 'Sneha', 'Bangalore', 28, 60000, 15),
(5, 'Karan', 'Mumbai', 35, 20000, 7),
(6, 'Pooja', 'Delhi', 27, 15000, 6),
(7, 'Arjun', 'Bangalore', 40, 70000, 20),
(8, 'Meera', 'Mumbai', 23, 5000, 2);

# Key SQL Queries
1. Filter Customers
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'Bangalore';
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE total_spent > 20000;
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 35;
2. Sorting & Aggregation
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

SELECT SUM(total_spent) AS total_revenue FROM customers;

SELECT AVG(total_spent) AS avg_spending FROM customers;
3. Grouping
SELECT city, SUM(total_spent) AS total_spending
FROM customers
GROUP BY city;

SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customers
GROUP BY city;
4. Customer Segmentation
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN total_spent > 50000 THEN 'High Value'
        WHEN total_spent BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'Medium Value'
        ELSE 'Low Value'
    END AS customer_segment,
    COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY customer_segment;
5. Average Spending per Customer
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    (total_spent / number_of_orders) AS avg_spending_per_customer
FROM customers;
6. HAVING Clause
SELECT city, SUM(total_spent) AS total_spending
FROM customers
GROUP BY city
HAVING SUM(total_spent) > 50000;

# Insights
Identified high, medium, and low value customers
Compared spending across cities
Calculated per-customer spending behavior
Used aggregation and filtering for business insights

# Conclusion
This project helps understand how SQL can be used for:

# Data analysis
Customer segmentation
Business decision making
Future Improvements
Add more customer data
Create dashboards using Power BI
Perform advanced segmentation (RFM Analysis)
