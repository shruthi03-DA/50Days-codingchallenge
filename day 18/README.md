# 📊 Social Media Data Analysis (SQL Project)

# 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world social media platform database (ConnectHub) and analyzes user activity, posts, likes, comments, and friendships using SQL.

The goal is to derive meaningful insights using:

JOINs
Subqueries
GROUP BY & HAVING
Stored Procedures
# 🗂️ Database Schema
The project consists of the following tables:

Users → Stores user details
Posts → Stores posts created by users
Likes → Tracks likes on posts
Comments → Stores comments on posts
Friendships → Stores user relationships

# ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Create Database
CREATE DATABASE social_media; USE social_media;

Create Tables
(Create all tables using SQL schema)

Insert Data
Run the provided ".sql" file to insert sample data.

# 📈 Tasks & Solutions

✅ Task 1: Basic JOINs
Posts with Username
SELECT p.post_id, u.username, p.content FROM Posts p JOIN Users u ON p.user_id = u.user_id;

Comments with Username
SELECT c.comment_id, u.username, c.comment_text FROM Comments c JOIN Users u ON c.user_id = u.user_id;

✅ Task 2: Data Analysis

Top 3 Users with Most Posts
SELECT u.username, COUNT(p.post_id) AS total_posts FROM Users u JOIN Posts p ON u.user_id = p.user_id GROUP BY u.username ORDER BY total_posts DESC LIMIT 3;

👉 Insight: Identifies most active users on platform.

Posts with Above Average Likes
SELECT post_id FROM Likes GROUP BY post_id HAVING COUNT() > ( SELECT AVG(like_count) FROM ( SELECT COUNT() AS like_count FROM Likes GROUP BY post_id ) t );

👉 Insight: Helps identify trending/viral posts.

Users Who Never Posted but Liked
SELECT DISTINCT u.username FROM Users u JOIN Likes l ON u.user_id = l.user_id LEFT JOIN Posts p ON u.user_id = p.user_id WHERE p.post_id IS NULL;

👉 Insight: Identifies passive users.

✅ Task 3: Relationships

Friends of a User (user_id = 3)
SELECT * FROM Friendships WHERE user_id1 = 3 OR user_id2 = 3;

Posts Liked by Friends
SELECT DISTINCT p.post_id FROM Posts p JOIN Likes l ON p.post_id = l.post_id JOIN Friendships f ON l.user_id = f.user_id1 OR l.user_id = f.user_id2 WHERE f.user_id1 = 3 OR f.user_id2 = 3;

👉 Insight: Used in social media feeds (e.g., “Your friend liked this”).

✅ Task 4: Stored Procedure
User Activity Summary
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserActivity(IN uid INT) BEGIN SELECT (SELECT COUNT() FROM Posts WHERE user_id = uid) AS total_posts, (SELECT COUNT() FROM Likes WHERE user_id = uid) AS total_likes_given, (SELECT COUNT() FROM Likes l JOIN Posts p ON l.post_id = p.post_id WHERE p.user_id = uid) AS likes_received, (SELECT COUNT() FROM Comments WHERE user_id = uid) AS total_comments; END $$
DELIMITER ;

👉 Run:
CALL GetUserActivity(3);

✅ Task 5: Most Influential User
SELECT u.username, COUNT(DISTINCT l.like_id) + COUNT(DISTINCT c.comment_id) AS score FROM Users u LEFT JOIN Posts p ON u.user_id = p.user_id LEFT JOIN Likes l ON p.post_id = l.post_id LEFT JOIN Comments c ON p.post_id = c.post_id GROUP BY u.username ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 1;

👉 Insight: Identifies top influencer based on engagement.
